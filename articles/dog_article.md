A 12-year-old boy has suffered "significant injuries" to his face and body after being attacked by a dog in England.

Emergency services rushed to the scene at the Bentilee housing estate in Stoke-on-Trent at around 2:00 p.m. on Thursday after receiving reports of the attack, a Staffordshire Police spokesperson told Newsweek.

As police arrived at the scene, officers found the boy suffering from injuries to his face, back, chest, and legs. A man in his 20s was also discovered with injuries to his legs caused by the attack.

The spokesperson said the boy was taken to the nearby Royal Stoke University Hospital by ambulance, where he is being treated for the injuries suffered.

The man was discharged at the scene after receiving medical treatment.

The police confirmed to Newsweek on Friday that the boy remains in hospital in a "serious condition," while the "ownership of two dogs was voluntarily transferred to police."

They added: "Following specialist advice it was established the dogs, believed to be the Cane Corso breed, could never be rehomed due to the violent act and should be humanely destroyed."

Cane Corsos are an Italian breed of Mastiffs, which are often used by owners as guard dogs due to their athletic builds and protective nature, according to a dog breed guide by TimeforPaws.

A spokesperson for the West Midlands Ambulance Service told Newsweek that it sent an air ambulance to the scene as well as a separate vehicle and a paramedic as part of its response on Thursday afternoon.

"We were called at 1.56pm to an emergency at a private residential property in Bentilee," the spokesperson said. "We sent one ambulance, a paramedic officer and the Midlands Air Ambulance from Cosford with a MERIT Trauma doctor and critical care paramedic on board to the scene.

"On arrival crews found one patient who had sustained serious injuries and was conveyed by land ambulance to hospital."

Authorities asked for anyone who witnessed the attack to "contact Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter or calling 101."

A similar incident occurred in April in nearby Normacot, located just 3.6 miles from Bentilee, when a boy suffered "serious injuries" after being bitten by a dog.

The attack, which took place at around 6:00 p.m. on Sunday April 18, caused the child to be taken to Royal Stoke University Hospital due to the injuries suffered, as local residents told StokeonTrentLive that a large number of police officers were seen in the area.
